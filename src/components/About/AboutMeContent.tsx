        About Me
      </h2>

      <p className="italic mb-4">Hi there,</p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Iâ€™m Samy ðŸ‘‹ and Iâ€™m a developer based in Brussels, but Iâ€™m also open to
        remote roles. I mainly work with React, Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase,
        and Framer Motion, but I can pick up new tech quickly if thatâ€™s what the
        job calls for.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        I like building web apps that are clean, fast, and easy to use â€”
        especially when thereâ€™s a focus on UI and user experience. For me, itâ€™s
        not just about writing code that works, but making sure it feels good
        for the people using it.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Outside of coding, I spend the rest of my time making music, DJing, or
        playing around with design. I think this creative side gives me a
        different perspective when I approach projects, but at the end of the
        day Iâ€™m just as into the technical side and problem-solving.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Iâ€™m fluent in French and English, and I know a bit of Dutch as well.
        Always curious and open to new challenges, Iâ€™m looking forward to
        growing as a dev and building things that make an impact.
      </p>

      <div className="mt-6">
        <p className="mb-1">Best,</p>
        <p className="font-semibold">Samy Alliche :)</p>
      </div>
    </SpotlightCard>
